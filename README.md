    npm install
    # Back to root
    cd ..
    ```
3.  **Set up Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    # Back to root
    cd ..
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Create a PostgreSQL database:**
    Connect to your PostgreSQL server (e.g., via `psql`):
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE "photo-tagging-db"; -- Or whatever name you prefer, update .env accordingly
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the **root directory** of the project and add your database credentials and backend port. Refer to `.env.example` for required variables.
    ```
    # Example .env content
    DB_USER=your_pg_user
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_DATABASE=photo-tagging-db
    DB_PASSWORD=your_pg_password
    DB_PORT=5432 # Default PostgreSQL port
    PORT=3001    # Backend server port
    ```
3.  **Initialize Database Schema and Data:**
    From the **root directory**, run the database setup script:
    ```bash
    node db/db_setup.js
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the **root directory**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The backend should start on `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured `PORT`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In a **new terminal**, navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev # or npm start, depending on your setup
    ```
    The frontend should open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173/`.
